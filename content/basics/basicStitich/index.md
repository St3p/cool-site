If this is your first time making amigurumi, you might find it useful to have a tutorial at hand. With the stitches explained. We suggest you practice the basic stitches before you start making one of the designs. This will help you to read the patterns and abbreviations more comfortably.


## chain (abbreviation: ch)

This stitch is the basis for many crochet patterns. If you’re working in rows, your first row will be a series of chain stitches. Use the hook to draw the yarn through the loop (1) and pull the loop until tight (2). Wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front. Pull the hook, carrying the yarn, through the loop already on your hook (3). You have now completed one chain stitch. Repeat these steps as indicated in the
pattern to create a foundation chain (4).

## single crochet  (abbreviation: sc)

Single crochet is the stitch that will be most frequently used in this book. Insert the hook into the next stitch (1) and wrap the yarn over the hook. Pull the yarn through the stitch (2). You will see that there are now two loops on the hook. Wrap the yarn over the hook again and pull it through both loops at once (3). You have now completed one single crochet (4). Insert the hook into the next stitch to continue (5).

## slip stitch (abbreviation: slst)

A slip stitch is used to move across one or more stitches at once or to finish a piece. Insert your hook into the next stitch (1). Wrap the yarn over the hook and draw through both loops at once (2).

## half double crochet (abbreviation: hdc)

(When starting a new row of half double crochet, work two chain stitches to gain height.) Bring your yarn over the hook from back to front before placing the hook in the stitch (1). Wrap the yarn over the hook and draw the yarn through the stitch. You now have three loops on the hook (2). Wrap the yarn over the hook again and pull it through all three loops on the hook (3). You have completed your first half double crochet. To continue, bring your yarn over the hook and insert it in the next stitch (4)

## double crochet (abbreviation: dc)

(When starting a new row of double crochet, work three chain stitches to gain height.) Bring your yarn over the hook from back to front before placing the hook in the stitch (1). Wrap the yarn over the hook and draw the yarn through the stitch. You now have three loops on the hook (2). Wrap the yarn over the hook again and pull it through the first two loops on the hook (3). You now have two loops on the hook. Wrap the yarn over the hook one last time and pull it through both loops on the hook (4). You have now completed one double crochet. To continue, bring your yarn over the hook and insert it in the next stitch (5).

## triple crochet (abbreviation: tr)

(When starting a new row of triple crochet, work four chain stitches to gain height.) Bring your yarn over the hook twice before placing the hook in the stitch (1). Wrap the yarn over the hook and draw the yarn through the stitch (2). Wrap the yarn over the hook again and pull it through the first two loops on the hook (3). Repeat this last step twice (4, 5). You have now completed one triple crochet stitch. To continue, bring your yarn over the hook twice and insert it in the next stitch.

## increase (abbreviation: inc)

To increase you make two single crochet stitches in the next stitch.

## invisible decrease (abbreviation: dec)

The invisible decrease is a method which will make your decrease stitch look much like the other stitches in the row, resulting in a smooth and even crochet fabric. Insert the hook in the front loop of your first stitch. Now immediately insert your hook in the front loop of the second stitch (1). You now have three loops on your hook. Wrap the yarn over the hook and pull it through the first two loops on your hook (2). Wrap the yarn over again and pull it through the two loops remaining on your hook (3). You have now completed one invisible decrease.

## invisibly decrease 3 stitches at once (abbreviation: sc3tog)

Insert the hook under the front loop only of the next three stitches (1). This gives you four loops on the hook (2). Wrap the yarn over the hook and pull it through the first three loops on your hook. Wrap the yarn over the hook again and pull it through the remaining two loops on the hook (3). You have now completed one sc3tog

## crochet around a foundation chain

Some pieces start with an oval instead of a circle. You make an oval by crocheting around a foundation chain. Crochet a
foundation chain with as many chains as mentioned in the pattern. Skip the first chain on the hook (1) and work a sc stitch in the next chain stitch (2, 3). Work your crochet stitches into each chain across as mentioned in the pattern. The last stitch before turning is usually an increase stitch (4). Now, turn your work upside down to work into the underside of the chain stitches. You’ll notice that only one loop is available, simply insert your crochet hook in this loop (5). Work your stitches into each chain across. When finished, your last stitch should be next to the first stitch you made (6). You can now continue working in spirals.

## magic ring

A magic ring is the ideal way to start crocheting in the round. You start by crocheting over an adjustable loop and finally pull the loop tight when you have finished the required number of stitches. The advantage of this method is that there’s no hole left in the middle of your starting round. Start with the yarn crossed to form a circle (1). Draw up a loop with your hook but don’t pull it tight (2). Hold the circle with your index finger and thumb and wrap the working yarn over your middle finger (3). Make one chain stitch by wrapping the yarn over the hook and pulling it through the loop on your hook (4, 5). Now insert your hook into the loop and underneath the tail. Wrap the yarn over the hook and draw up a loop (6). Wrap
the yarn over the hook again (7) and pull it through both loops on your hook. You
have now completed your first single crochet stitch (8). Continue to crochet (repeating step 6, 7, 8) until you have the required number of stitches as mentioned in the pattern. Now grab the yarn tail and pull to draw the center of the ring tightly closed (9, 10). You can now begin your second round by crocheting into the first single crochet stitch of the
magic ring. You can use a stitch marker to remember where you started. If you don't want to use this technique, you can start each piece using the following technique: ch 2, x sc into the second chain from the hook – where x is the number of sc stitches you would make in your magic ring.

## front loops only (abbreviation: FLO) and back loops only (abbreviation: BLO)

When making a crochet stitch, you end up with two loops at the top of the stitch, a front loop towards you (1) and a back loop (2). When asked to crochet FLO or BLO you make the same stitch but leave one loop untouched.

## back post or front post single crochet (abbreviation: BPsc, FPsc)

To make a back post or front post single crochet, insert the hook from right to left around the vertical post of the next stitch according to the picture. Wrap the yarn over the hook and draw up a loop. Finish the single crochet stitch as usual.

## spike stitch

Instead of working into the two loops of the next stitch, work into the corresponding stitch in the round below (1). Wrap the yarn over the hook and pull it through the stitch. You now have two loops on your hook. Wrap the yarn over the hook once more and pull it through both loops on your hook (2). You have now completed one spike stitch.

## french knot

The French knot is a sewing stitch. Insert a threaded embroidery needle from the back to the front through the stitch where you want the knot to show. Keep the tip of the needle flat against your crochetwork and wrap the yarn around your needle twice (1). Carefully pull the needle through these loops so that you end up with a double knot. Insert the needle in the crochet stitch next to the knot (2) – not in the same stitch, this will make the knot disappear – and fasten the yarn at the back.

## invisible color change

When you want to switch from one color to the next, you work to within two stitches before a color change. Make the next stitch as usual, but don’t pull the final loop through (1). Instead, wrap the new color of yarn around your hook and pull it through the remaining loops (2). To make a neat color change, you can make the first stitch in the new color a slip stitch instead of a single crochet. Don’t pull the slip stitch too tight or it will be difficult to crochet into in the next round. Tie the loose tails in a knot and leave them on the inside.

## fastening off

When you’ve finished crocheting, cut the yarn a couple of inches / cm from your last stitch. Pull the yarn through the last loop until it is all the way through (1). You now have a finished knot. Thread the long tail through a tapestry needle and insert your tapestry needle through the back loop of the next stitch (2). This way the finishing knot will remain invisible in your finished piece. You can use this piece of yarn to continue sewing the pieces together.
