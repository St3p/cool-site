{{< figureCupper

* Pin and sew rounds 11-18 of the head to the body, adding more fiberfill to the neck before closing the seam (picture 12).

{{< figureCupper

command="Resize"
options="700x" >}}

* Sew the first 3 rounds of the foot to the leg (pictures 13-14). Position the legs on each side of the body. The feet should be aligned with the bottom of the body, so that the mouse can stand properly. Use pins to secure the legs in place and use gray yarn to sew around the leg (picture 15).

* Pin and sew the arms to each side of the body, 1 round below the neck seam.
* Pin the tail to the back of the body. The tail should start on round 6 and should help to keep the mouse upright. Adjust the position if necessary and sew it on (picture 16).

## whiskers
* Take a long strand of gray yarn and a yarn needle. Insert your needle at the bottom of the head and bring it out where you want the whiskers to appear. Pull the yarn through.
* Insert your needle in the exact same place, making a loop of yarn, and run your needle through the head to the other side where you want the whiskers to appear.
* Insert the needle in the exact same place and form another loop. Run through the head to the same place where you started (picture 17).

{{< figureCupper

* You have two loops of yarn where the whiskers should appear. The numbers on the picture show the movements of your needle (picture 18).

{{< figureCupper

* Take 4 strands of silver fingering weight yarn and tie them around the loops (2 threads at each loop). Leave the long yarn ends (picture 19).

{{< figureCupper

* Pull the ends of gray yarn tightly, so that the whiskers are pulled into the head a bit. Knot and weave in the remaining ends of gray yarn (picture 20).
