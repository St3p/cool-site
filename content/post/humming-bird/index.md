*	Insert a pipe cleaner into the beak to help it keep shape and sew the beak to the body, centered between the eyes and aligned to the top of the throat patch.
*	Position the wide edge of the back onto the color change, at 6 stitches from either eye. Sew the back to the body (first along the top and then down to the tip along both sides) (pictures 3-4).
