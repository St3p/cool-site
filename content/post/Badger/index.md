## shaping the face

You can shape the badger’s face to give it more definition. Take a length of light gray yarn on your yarn needle. Insert the needle into the head at the back of the neck and bring it out at the top inner side of the right eye. Bring it back in 2 stitches below that point and bring it across to the top inner side of the left eye. Pull the yarn a bit. Bring the needle back in 2 stitches below that point and bring it back out at the top inner side of the right eye. Pull the yarn firmly, until you have the expression you want (arrows on picture 9). Bring the needle back into the head, and out at the point in the neck, one stitch next to where you started. make a knot and weave in the yarn ends. Embroider a white line on the outer side of each eye.
