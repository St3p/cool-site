Fasten off, leaving a yarn tail. Using your yarn needle, weave the yarn tail through the front loop of each remaining stitch and pull it tight to close. Weave in the yarn end. Use black embroidery thread and a sewing needle to embroider the eyes with backstitches on round 17. The eyes are 5 stitches wide and start on the alignment of the inner increase of round 19 (pictures 1-2). After embroidering the eyes, wrap the thread around each stitch to make a thicker line. Tie the loose ends together and hide them inside the head (picture 3). To add the bottom lashes, separate your thread, using only half the number of strands, and sew a small line through each of the stitches of the eyes on round 18, making 5 lashes in total.
