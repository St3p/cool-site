## head (start in white yarn)

The head is worked from the muzzle to the back of the head. At the back of the head, we will crochet rounds that leave open front loops to work the mane into later. Ch 6. Work around both sides of the foundation chain.

Rnd 1: skip first ch on the hook, inc in next st, sc in next 3 st, 3 sc in last st. Continue on the other side of the foundation chain, sc in next 4 st [12]

Rnd 2: (sc in next st, inc in next st, sc in next 3 st, inc in next st) repeat 2 times [16]

Rnd 3: (sc in next st, inc in next 2 st, sc in next 3 st, inc in next 2 st) repeat 2 times [24]

Rnd 4 – 6: sc in all 24 st [24] Change to yellow yarn.

Rnd 7: FLO slst in all 24 st [24]

Find the middle stitch in the foundation chain. Move up from the middle stitch to the stitch above on Rnd 7 and mark this stitch.

Rnd 8: BLO of Rnd 7, sc to 3 st before the middle marker, inc in next 3 st, sc in next st and move the marker to this st, inc in next 3 st, sc in all remaining st [30]

Rnd 9: sc in all 30 st, move the middle marker along [30] Count 5 stitches to either side of the middle stitch marker and mark both stitches with a scrap of yarn. This will show you where to insert the safety eyes later.

Rnd 10: sc to 6 st before the middle marker, (inc in next st, sc in next st) repeat 3 times, sc in next st and discard the middle marker, (sc in next st, inc in next st) repeat 3 times, sc in all remaining st [36]

Rnd 11: sc in all 36 st [36]

Rnd 12: (inc in next st, sc in next 5 st) repeat 6 times [42] Rnd 13: (inc in next st, sc in next 6 st) repeat 6 times [48] Rnd 14: (inc in next st, sc in next 7 st) repeat 6 times [54] Fasten off the yellow yarn. Mark the middle stitch under the chin on Rnd 14 with a stitch marker. This
is now the start of the next round. Pull up a loop of brown yarn.

Rnd 15: sc in all 54 st [54]

Rnd 16: sc in next 6 st, BLO sc in next 43 st, continue in both loops, sc in next 5 st [54]

Rnd 17: sc in all 54 st [54]

Rnd 18: sc in next 6 st, BLO sc in next 43 st, continue in both loops, sc in next 5 st [54]

Rnd 19: sc in all 54 st [54]

Rnd 20: BLO (dec, sc in next 7 st) repeat 6 times [48]

Rnd 21: (dec, sc in next 6 st) repeat 6 times [42]

Insert the safety eyes in the stitches marked earlier. Stuff the head with fiberfill and continue stuffing as you go.

Rnd 22: BLO (dec, sc in next 5 st) repeat 6 times [36]

Rnd 23: (dec, sc in next 4 st) repeat 6 times [30]

Rnd 24: BLO (dec, sc in next 3 st) repeat 6 times [24]

Rnd 25: (dec, sc in next 2 st) repeat 6 times [18] Rnd 26: BLO (dec, sc in next st) repeat 6 times [12] Rnd 27: dec 6 times [6]

Fasten off, leaving a yarn tail. Using your yarn needle, weave the yarn tail through the front loop of each remaining stitch and pull it tight to close. Weave in the yarn end (pictures 1-3, orange lines in the pictures show leftover front loops you'll be working the mane in).

## leg (make 2, start in white yarn)
note: There will be a color change in the bobble stitches on the legs. You will need to change to brown yarn for every 5-dc-bobble stitch. Switch back to white yarn for all other stitches. To change color smoothly, start your bobble in brown yarn, but when you have your 6 loops left on the hook, yarn over with the white yarn and pull through all 6 loops on the hook to com- plete the stitch. When making color changes, drop the yarn you are not using to the back of your work and pick it up again when you need it, being careful not to pull it too loose or too tight when starting again.

## shaping the Feet

Take your needle and a long length of white yarn to shape the toes. Make 3 stitches in between the bobble stitches. Stitch between the first two bobble stitches, into round 2 of the foot, and make a long stitch, exiting vertically between rounds 10 and 11. Stitch again in the same place, looping the yarn around the foot and pulling it tightly. Repeat this stitch a few times and fasten off securely. Repeat this two times, between the other bobble stitches (pictures 8-9).
